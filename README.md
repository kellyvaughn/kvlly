## Hello!

This is my first project with Gatsby, and is probably super basic (jk it's absolutely basic). I'm fully open to recommendations on how to make all of this better, so if you have ideas of fun things I can try out on here or ways I can improve my code, I'd love to hear what you think! [Shoot me an email](mailto:kelly@thetaproom.com) with your thoughts.

## Lesson Log

### 1: Get up and running

It all started with flat white and a dream in a coffee shop. I wanted to learn something new, so here we are. I queried Twitter for their recommendations on what to use to build a personal site. The responses were overwhelmingly for Gatsby. So off I went. 3 hours of work + reading later, [I had a site up](https://kvlly.com).

### 2: Figure out Twitter card images

I don't know why this was so difficult, but it took me longer than I would like to figure it out. Anyway, there's an image attached to the Twitter card now.

### 3: I like coffee

I was curious to see how the ecommerce integration with Stripe worked, so I built an additional page to let people buy me coffee. Not because I expect people to buy me coffee, of course. But I'm really good at talking about coffee. Some number of hours of work later, [here we are](https://kvlly.com/buy-kelly-coffee).

### 4: Now I can blog! Wait... now I have to blog

I figure if I'm going to talk about blogging, I should probably add it to my site as well. I don't have comments on there yet and the layout is super basic, but it technically works so I'm not upset. I only have one blog post for you to enjoy at the moment. It took me a really long time to write. (No it didn't.)

### 5: Turns out I'm not blogging. But I am speaking!

I added a new page for speaking engagements and removed the blog. I never got past the first blog post. Maybe 2020 will be the year I blog.

### 6: What am I up to right now?

I love the idea of keeping a "Now" page up to date based on what I'm currently doing + interested in. It's fun! [Learn more here](https://nownownow.com/about). The page is live on my site [now](https://kvlly.com/now). (ha ha get it?)

### 7: What is headless commerce?

This one will be in progress for a while! I created a Shopify store to learn how to use Shopify's [Storefront API](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/storefront-api) in a headless fashion. The result is a fully functional online store directly built into Gatsby. [Take a peek!](https://kvlly.com/shop/)
