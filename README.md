## Hello!

This is my first project with Gatsby, and is probably super basic (jk it's absolutely basic). I'm fully open to recommendations on how to make all of this better, or if you have ideas of fun things I can try out on here, I'd love to hear it!

## Lesson Log

### 1: Get up and running

It all started with flat white and a dream in a coffee shop. I wanted to learn something new, so here we are. I queried Twitter for their recommendations on what to use to build a personal site. The responses were overwhelmingly for Gatsby. So off I went. 3 hours of work + reading later, [I had a site up](https://kvlly.com).

### 2: Figure out Twitter card images

I don't know why this was so difficult, but it took me longer than I would like to figure it out. Anyway, there's an image attached to the Twitter card now.

### 3: I like coffee

I was curious to see how the ecommerce integration with Stripe worked, so I built an additional page to let people buy me coffee. Not because I expect people to buy me coffee, of course. But I'm really good at talking about coffee. Some number of hours of work later, [here we are](https://kvlly.com/buy-kelly-coffee).
